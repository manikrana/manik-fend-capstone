# Project Details

# 1. In this travel app, user enters his/her travel details - city which they wish to travel to and the date of travel. The code validates that a valid city is entered and the date of travel is in future.

# 2. Once validated, the app interfaces with 3 different APIs. It shows current weather (if the travel is within a week), or predicted weather (if date of travel is after a week. It also shows a sample photo of the city being visited.
